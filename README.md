The current project is a basic recipe website. The skills I will have demonstrated once I have completed this project are writing the basic boilerplate for an HTML document, creating paragraphs, creating headings, creating bold text, creating italicized text, creating HTML webpages in a code editor, creating unordered lists, creating ordered lists, creating links to other pages on the same website, and creating images in HTML.
